# OctoAcme Project Management Docs README

## Overview
This folder contains OctoAcme's core project management process documents. The goal is to provide a concise landing page for new teammates and anyone who needs quick access to our structured program management resources.

## Summary of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme follows a lightweight, structured approach focused on stakeholder alignment, iterative planning and delivery, risk management, and continuous improvement. Key activities include:
- Initiation: define goals, success criteria, key stakeholders, and high-level scope.
- Planning: create and maintain a prioritized plan with milestones, owners, and dependencies.
- Execution & Tracking: deliver work iteratively, monitor progress against milestones, and surface blockers early.
- Risk Management & Communication: identify, assess, and communicate risks and mitigation plans.
- Release & Deployment: coordinate release tasks and rollbacks with clear roles and checklists.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: run regular retrospectives and feed improvements back into process and documentation.
- Roles & Ownership: clearly defined roles (e.g., Product Lead, Delivery Lead, Engineering Owner, QA) with documented responsibilities for repeatability and onboarding.

Our processes emphasize transparency, concise documentation, and repeatability so teammates can quickly find the right resource and follow a consistent workflow.
