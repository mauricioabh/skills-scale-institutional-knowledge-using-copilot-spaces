# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how we run projects, from initial concept through delivery and retrospective. Our processes are designed to be customer-first, iterative, and data-informed, emphasizing clear ownership, psychological safety, and continuous improvement. Whether you're joining the team or looking to understand how we deliver value, these resources will help you navigate our project lifecycle effectively.

OctoAcme's project management framework encompasses the full delivery lifecycle. We begin with **initiation**, where we validate business needs, identify stakeholders, and define success metrics through a lightweight one-pager. During **planning**, we break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and create release timelines. Throughout **execution and tracking**, teams follow a consistent rhythm of standups, demos, and weekly syncs while maintaining quality through automated testing and code reviews. Our approach emphasizes clear roles and responsibilities, with Project Managers coordinating delivery, Product Managers defining outcomes, and cross-functional teams collaborating to build solutions.

Communication and risk management are central to our process. We maintain regular touchpoints including weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates, supported by a structured risk register and escalation paths. Quality assurance is built into every stage through Definition of Done, automated CI testing, security scanning, and acceptance criteria validation. **Release and deployment** follows a standardized approach with pre-release checklists, smoke testing, and clear rollback procedures. After each sprint or major milestone, we conduct **retrospectives** to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous enhancement.
